/**
 * @class argos._CustomizationMixin
 * Customization Mixin is a general purpose Customization Engine. It takes a customization object and
 * a layout object and applies the customization defined to the layout.
 *
 * A customization object has the following properties:
 *
 * * `at`: `function(item)` - passes the current item in the list, the function should return true if this is the item being modified (or is at where you want to insert something).
 * * `at`: `{Number}` - May optionally define the index of the item instead of a function.
 * * `type`: `{String}` - enum of `insert`, `modify`, `replace` or `remove` that indicates the type of customization.
 * * `where`: `{String}` - enum of `before` or `after` only needed when type is `insert`.
 * * `value`: `{Object}` - the entire object to create (insert or replace) or the values to overwrite (modify), not needed for remove.
 * * `value`: `{Object[]}` - if inserting you may pass an array of items to create.
 *
